Volume Manager
  provides and manages tree instances
  tree instance is a pointer
  does patch/layer merging. 

Tree base
  array stack 

Tree instance
  local cursor 
    the volume manager needs to be able to reset this in all instances
  pointer to base tree info
  mutex
    used by Volume Manager to lock all instances

  layering/patching for local instances
    each instances has its own local write tree,
	when read happens in a different instance read all existing trees

  scoped mutex locking
    require a scope handle to be created when accessing the tree
	  similar to a transaction
	  keeps the mutex from being check constantly with each method call
	  would be non movable
